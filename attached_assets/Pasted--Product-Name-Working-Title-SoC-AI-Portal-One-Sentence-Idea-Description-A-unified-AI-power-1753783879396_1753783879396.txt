🛡️ Product Name (Working Title)
SoC-AI Portal

🧠 One-Sentence Idea Description
A unified, AI-powered Security Operations Center (SoC) web app that supports Tier 1–3 analysts by triaging alerts, simplifying investigations, enabling proactive threat detection, and streamlining reporting — all from a single dashboard.

👥 Target Audience
Tier 1 analysts → Need fast triage and prioritization of alerts

Tier 2 analysts → Focused on investigations, script analysis, threat correlation

Tier 3 analysts / Managers → Focused on high-risk threat patterns, custom reporting, and SoC KPIs

Use cases: SoC command center, remote incident response, daily security operations

🧭 User Journey / Flow
Tier 1 logs in and sees a prioritized list of AI-triaged alerts with suggested actions

Escalated alerts move to Tier 2, who uses AI to automate script analysis and correlate threat intelligence

Tier 3 views high-risk insights, gets deep threat context, and auto-generated role-based reports

Analysts can @tag each other, comment on alerts, and assign tasks within the platform

SoC managers view dashboards showing MTTD, MTTR, false positives, and escalation rates

🛠️ Core Features
🔔 Real-time AI-prioritized alert feed

💬 AI chat assistant for guided investigations

🌐 Threat graph visualizer showing cross-tool correlations

📄 Automated, role-based report generator (Tier 3 + management)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Analyst collaboration tools: tagging, comments, task assignment

📊 SoC KPI dashboard: MTTD, MTTR, false positives, escalation rates

🔁 Workflow handoff from Tier 1 → 2 → 3
